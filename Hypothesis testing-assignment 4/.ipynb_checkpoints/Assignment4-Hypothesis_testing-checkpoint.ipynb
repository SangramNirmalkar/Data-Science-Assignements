    "# Background:\n",
    "Bombay hospitality Ltd. operates a franchise model for producing exotic Norwegian dinners throughout New England. The operating cost for a franchise in a week (W) is given by the equation W = $1,000 + $5X, where X represents the number of units produced in a week. Recent feedback from restaurant owners suggests that this cost model may no longer be accurate, as their observed weekly operating costs are higher.\n",

    "# Objective:\n",
    "To investigate the restaurant owners' claim about the increase in weekly operating costs using hypothesis testing.\n",
    "Data Provided:\n",

    "•\tThe theoretical weekly operating cost model: W = $1,000 + $5X\n",
